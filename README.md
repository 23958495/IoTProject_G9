# Smart ShelterGuard Arduino Code and Usage Guide

Welcome to the Smart ShelterGuard repository. This repository contains the Arduino code for the Smart ShelterGuard system, as well as a comprehensive usage guide in .md format. The Arduino code is stored in the 'Final_ShelterGuard' folder.

## Arduino Code

The Arduino code is designed to run on the LILYGO T-Beam v1.1 board, which is a part of the Smart ShelterGuard system. The code facilitates the integration of sensors, relay modules, and interaction with the BLYNK IoT Cloud platform. It offers an efficient and automated solution for monitoring and controlling environmental conditions in animal shelters.

## Usage Guide

To set up and operate the Smart ShelterGuard system effectively, please refer to our [Usage Guide](UsageGuide.md). This guide provides detailed instructions on hardware setup, software installation, system usage, and much more.
